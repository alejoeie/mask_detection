# mask_detection
Here is a mask detection project using openCV, with several errors and bugs that need to be fixed

This code is based on a project progress for a programming course. This is not the final product.

Requisites:

  1. You need to install openCV dependencies to make it work correctly, otherwise you will get several errors.
  
  2. You need to install openCV libraries if you are a GNU/Linux user.
  
  3. In case you use GNU/Linux with a VirtualBox, you need to install Virtualbox Extensions in order
  to work with your camera. After that, you need to define the camera number in the line code that says:
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) --> 0 is the number for my integrated camera, in case you have another camera, you
  need to switch it to the correct number.
